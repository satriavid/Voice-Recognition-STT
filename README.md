# Voice Recognition (Speech-To-Text) with Whisper and MINDS14

Welcome to the Voice Recognition project using the Whisper model and the MINDS14 dataset! This project focuses on performing speech-to-text transcription and evaluating the performance of the Whisper model on the MINDS14 dataset. This is a project as a part of AI Bootcamp Program by Indonesia AI.

## Overview

This project leverages the power of OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe audio samples from the MINDS14 dataset, which contains spoken data for intent detection in the e-banking domain. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), transcription of audio samples, and evaluation of transcription accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project Structure

- **Voice_Recognition.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for loading the dataset, performing EDA, transcribing audio samples, and evaluating the model's performance.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage details, and more.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `Voice_Recognition.ipynb` to run the project step-by-step. Here's a brief overview of the notebook content:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand the dataset through various visualizations and statistical summaries.

### 2. Transcription with Whisper

Transcribe audio samples using the Whisper model and compare the results with the provided transcriptions.

### 3. Evaluation

Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the Whisper model on the MINDS14 dataset.

### 4. Fine-Tuning and Re-eval

Finetune Whisper with MINDS14 dataset then re-evaluate the metrics

### How to Run the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `Voice_Recognition.ipynb` and run the cells step-by-step.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, transcriptions of audio samples using the Whisper model, and an evaluation of the model's performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
